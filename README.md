# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the **Titanic dataset** using Python. The main goal is to explore the dataset, answer key questions, and visualize insights related to passengers aboard the Titanic.

# Key Features
### Data Loading

1.Loaded the Titanic dataset using the Seaborn library.
Conducted an initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure.
Passenger Analysis

2.Addressed key questions such as:
What is the total number of passengers in the dataset?
Data Cleaning and Preparation

3.Cleaned the dataset, handling any missing values where necessary to ensure accuracy in analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

4.Explored trends and patterns in passenger data, such as:
Passenger demographics (e.g., age, gender, class)
Survival rates across different groups
Visualized the findings using bar plots, histograms, and other charts.

# Tools and Technologies
Python

Pandas for data manipulation

Seaborn for data loading

NumPy for numerical operations

# Insights and Outcomes
### Total Passengers

Determined the total number of passengers in the dataset.
Demographic Insights

Analyzed patterns among passengers, such as survival rates across classes and genders.
Visual Representations

Created clear and insightful visualizations to illustrate trends and key findings in the data.
